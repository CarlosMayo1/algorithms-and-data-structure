# algorithms-and-data-structure
This is a repo in which I will post some algorithms solved by myself. This my challenge, I want to improve my skills abilities and keep track of my progress.

I am a self-taugh programmer and I feel passion for learning, during my studies I've found algorithms and I ended fascinated. So I challange myself to imporve my abilities. Right now I am solving Free Code Camp exercises, but as soon as I finish I will go to Project Euler.

This is just my personal repo in which I just want to keep track of my progress. 
The solution that are posted here are my own solutions, without seen the solution proposed.
Feel free to suggest and of course I am definetely open to new point of view.
